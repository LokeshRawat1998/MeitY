        <h5><b>Special Manpower Development Program for Chips to System Design (SMDP-C2SD)</b></h5>

          <p>
            During the 9th Plan, MeitY (erstwhile DeitY) had initiated the
            Special Manpower Development Programme in VLSI Design and Related
            Software (SMDP-I) with a view to increase India's share of the
            Global VLSI Design market from 0.5% to 5% by the end of 9th Plan
            period by making available specialized manpower required by the
            Design Centers/ Industry. The project was initiated at nineteen
            institutions in 1998 with total outlay of Rs. 14.99 Crores and was
            completed in March 2005. Seeing the impact of SMDP-I, MeitY
            (erstwhile DeitY) in the 10th Plan initiated SMDP-II with an aim to
            increase the global VLSI Design market share to around 15% by 2010.
            It also aimed to increase the availability of specialized manpower
            in the area of VLSI design so that the annual turnover from design
            houses could reach a figure of about Rs. 5000 Crores by the year
            2010. SMDP-II was initiated with a total outlay of Rs. 49.98 Crores
            (over a period of 5 years) at 32 institutions. 7 Resource Centers
            (mainly IITs, IISc and CEERI) mentored 25 Participating Institutions
            (NITs and few others) for implementation of SMDP-II. SMDP-II
            concluded in the year 2013.

          <h4><b>Vision</b></h4>
          <p>
            The workforce in semiconductor design industry in India in 2009 was
            around 1,35,000. It grew at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
            of 20% and was more than 2,30,000 in 2012. The Semiconductor Design
            Industry was around US$ 10.6 Billion by 2012. However, if it is
            proposed to achieve turnover of US$ 55 Billion by 2020 in the area
            of VLSI, Chip Design and other Frontier Technical Areas, it will
            require a sizable skilled manpower to meet these targets. The
            Government is also promoting Electronics System Design and
            Manufacturing (ESDM) in the country.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="c3">
          <h4><b>Mission</b></h4>
          <p>
            In the National Policy on Electronics, it is proposed to achieve
            turnover of US$ 400 billion by 2020. It follows that there is a need
            to develop manpower that has expertise not only in VLSI design but
            also in System on Chip/ System Development. Thus, there is a need to
            initiate an integrated program entitled 'Special Manpower
            Development for Chips to System' which not only aims at developing
            specialized manpower in VLSI but also emphasizes on development of
            working prototypes of System on Chip/ System using mostly ASICs/ ICs
            designed in the program. This will, therefore, be a step towards
            bringing a 'SoC/System' development culture in academic institutions
            in the country.

          <h4><b>Objectives</b></h4>
          <p>The main objectives of the Special Manpower Development Program for Chips to System Development are:
            <ol style="list-style-type:disc;">
              <li>Bring in a culture of System on Chip/ System designing by developing working prototypes with societal applications.</li>
              <li>Capacity building in the area of VLSI/ Microelectronics and Chips to System Development.</li>
              <li>Broaden the base of ASIC/ IC designing in the country.</li>
              <li>Broaden the R&D base of Microelectronics/ Chips to System Design through networked PhD program.</li>
              <li>Promote 'Knowledge Exchange Program'.</li>
              <li>Protection of Intellectual Property generated.</li>
